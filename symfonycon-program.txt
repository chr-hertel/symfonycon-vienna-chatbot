Workshop: Getting the Most Out of PHPStan
Trainer: Ondřej Mirtes
Description:
PHP is nothing like compiled languages. If you make a mistake, the program will crash when the line of code with the mistake is executed. When testing a PHP application, whether manually or automatically, developers spend a lot of their time discovering mistakes that wouldn’t even compile in other languages, leaving less time for testing actual business logic.
PHPStan is a popular static analyser focused on finding bugs in your code. By leveraging the strength of PHP type system further enhanced in PHPStan itself, developers can create robust applications and discover bugs early in the development process. The aid the tool provides during refactoring is also indispensable.
In this workshop, the attendees will learn how to install, configure and run PHPStan, and also receive tips how to write code so that PHPStan can be as powerful as possible. They will also be able to write their own PHPStan rules and extensions.

Workshop: Mastering OOP & Design Patterns
Trainer: Alexandre Salomé
Description:
Last seats There are no seats available for this workshop on December 3, 2024.
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) goes beyond the design of classes and interfaces. It includes a wide variety of concepts such as objects, entities, value objects, services, design models, SOLID principles, calisthenics, coupling, etc. Mastering OOP often requires several years of experience.
This workshop will help you to better understand all these concepts in order to write more maintainable, robust and testable object-oriented code. You will also discover techniques to reduce the complexity of your code and make your classes more specific and therefore simpler. You will also learn how to recognize and exploit the power of design models (factory, adapter, composite, decorator, mediator, strategy, etc.).

Workshop: Symfony 7: the fast track
Trainer: Nicolas Grekas
Description:
This training is from the book "Symfony 7: The Fast Track" by Fabien Potencier. In 2 days, it will teach you how to build a Symfony application from A to Z using new practices and new components. For those who are new to Symfony, this training is an opportunity to discover capabilities of Symfony. For more experienced devs, it's an opportunity to know about and to discover the latest features and best practices.
We will build an application with all the infrastructure of modern apps: database, application and HTTP cache server, message bus for background processing, etc. We will start from the basics with the installation of a skeleton application, the creation of a data model and a "backoffice", then we will add screens for users, a security system to partition rights. We will enrich the business rules to send notifications, send emails, manage a publication workflow, etc. Finally, we will optimize the application for production through HTTP and application caches, through asset management (JS/CSS/images) and secrets management. To secure each step, we will write tests to guarantee non-regressions.
On the menu: Flex, DependencyInjection, Mailer, Workflow, Messenger, HttpClient, String, etc.

Talk: HTTP compression in Symfony apps
Speaker: Kévin Dunglas
Description:
Compressing HTTP responses can significantly improve the performance of your Symfony applications. But you still need to find your way through the jungle of standards and formats.
In this presentation, we'll discover how HTTP compression works, the different formats supported by modern web browsers (deflate, gzip, Brotli, and the brand new Zstandard), and how to use them correctly with Symfony.
We'll also look at which formats to compress, which not to, when to use dynamic compression, and when (and how) to pre-compress responses that can be compressed for even better performance.

Talk: From Translations to Multi Dimension Entities
Speaker: Alexander Schranz
Description:
Content management is more than just adding a text editor to your project. Initially, you may only need a basic text editor for your Entity. However, as your project grows, you might require support for multiple languages, and when drafting or versioning come into play, things can get tricky.
In this talk, I will provide a quick introduction to different ways of data modeling and the libraries available to meet these needs. I'll also share a brief history of Sulu's content storage and explain why we decided to redesign the entire content storage system for a better future.
You'll learn how to evolve from a simple Doctrine entity to a translatable entity, and finally, to a multi-dimensional entity that supports multiple languages, drafting, versioning, and more. These concepts are reusable even if you're not using our beloved CMS.

Talk: A brand-new way to serialize data in Symfony
Speaker: Mathias Arlaud
Description:
Serialization plays an essential role in any information system, and particularly in the context of a web application, as it is one of the pivots of the HTTP request/response cycle. That's why Symfony's Serializer component is one of the most critical for our applications.
Needs evolve, and since its creation, this old component has found itself confronted with new problems and has in some ways reached its own limits.
That's why it's now necessary to completely rethink the way we serialize data in the Symfony ecosystem.
So let's take a look at two Symfony component drafts: the JsonEncoder and the ObjectMapper, and how they interact to provide a brand-new way of serializing data.

Talk: Platforms & Frameworks Eat Culture for Breakfast
Speaker: Nigel
Description:
As tech leaders we like to think we’re responsible for driving organisational and cultural change, but in most cases, we’re just catching up to the possibilities created by new kinds of software, and re-forming our engineering organisations to take advantage of them.
Organisational dynamics are critical, but success at enabling fast flow is ultimately dependent upon how well your tech stack enables it. It’s technology that drives progress.
In this talk Nigel will take a tour through some history of the DevOps movement, findings from a decade of State of DevOps Reports, his experience driving change at large and small companies, discuss some relevant inflection points in software and how they influence organisational dynamics, argue that the dominance of “culture” topics divorced from technological progress fails to advance our industry, and demonstrate how platform and framework adoption drives the best kind of cultural changes.

Talk: The missing Gotenberg Bundle. Components, Assemble!
Speaker: Hubert Lenoir
Speaker: Adrien Roches
Description:
Since wkhtmltopdf was deprecated, it is difficult to find an easy to use / setup library to generate PDF's.
Amongst the existing solutions, we chose to focus solely on Gotenberg.
The existing SDK did not match our needs as it provides only static classes, so we decided to give a try and create ourselves a brand new Bundle with the DX possible for Symfony Developpers & PHPStorm users.
From the fast HttpClient to the forgotten Webhook, let's see how existing components can help us to make PDF generation fast and easy to use.
To do so we had to ask ourselves a few questions which we will cover together !
How do we expose a friendly, yet semantic configuration ?
How to ensure great auto-completion for ease of use ?
What needs to be done to have a proper Profiler ?
How to keep memory efficiency by leveraging the HttpClient ?
How to make the asynchrone generation easy ?

Talk: The Role of Empathy in Technical Writing
Speaker: Kemi Elizabeth Ojogbede
Description:
It’s easy to assume that our users are experts when writing documentation. But technical writing without diagrams, code examples, videos, screenshots and more can ostracise a large chunk of users who are simply searching for help when using your product. When writing technical documentation, empathy allows us to imagine ourselves as the reader: a junior developer who just started on the job, a sales manager who needs more information for a client deck, a member of the customer success team helping a client on a video call. When we’re able to understand that our docs form the foundation of knowledge for a wide range of users, we’re able to write in a manner that positively impacts all. We may be writing about logical concepts, but our approach can definitely benefit from a bit of heart. This talk will break down the vital role empathy plays in the process of writing technical documentation for users from all business backgrounds.

Talk: Running Symfony in a Multi-Process Container
Speaker: Anne-Julia Seitz
Description:
The deployment scenario for PHP looks a little different than for other languages like Go or Ruby that have embedded webservers. The classic stack of NGINX/Apache + php-fpm doesn't perfectly fit in the container world.
Some solution providers, like DigitalOcean or certain Azure products, only allow for single containers to be deployed.
In this talk, we'll explore ways other people have solved this, like FrankenPHP, Framework-X , and others. For production deployments, there is k8s, swarm, compose, and running everything in one multiprocess container.
These single containers could be orchestrated with systemd, supervisord, or Runit. We'll talk about the benefits and downsides of these solutions, compare them with the choice we made for our last project, s6-overlay, show off the s6-cli project I developed for this purpose and talk about recipes for running database migrations, cronjobs and a few more.

Talk: Symfony Authentication: What's next?
Speaker: Robin Chalas
Description:
The Security component has changed a lot in the past few years.
From Authentication Listeners to Guard and finally the Authenticator Manager system, Symfony now has the most robust infrastructure ever to support most if not all modern, industry-standard Security protocols.
The community started building on these new foundations by introducing an AccessTokenAuthenticator and kept improving it since then, notably through adding more token handlers for well-known authentication protocols.
That's pretty cool already, but what should we expect next? How far will we take it?
In this talk, I'm going to put my Security maintainer hat on to answer these questions and share some insights about what's going on in this critical part of our beloved framework.
